**Login Feature Testing Project**

This project focuses on testing the login functionality, specifically addressing negative scenarios where invalid credentials are used. 
The tests validate that appropriate warning messages are displayed when incorrect login details are entered.

**Key Features**
- **Page Object Model**: Uses the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to create a clear structure for interacting with the login page.
- **Hooks**: Implements hooks for pre-test and post-test actions to streamline test execution and environment management.
- **Assertions**: Verifies that the application displays the correct warning messages for invalid credentials.
- **Exception Handling**: Implements exception handling to manage unexpected issues during test execution.
- **Fixtures**: Utilizes fixtures to set up and tear down test environments efficiently.
- **Inheritance**: Leverages inheritance to reuse common test setup and utility functions across different test cases.
